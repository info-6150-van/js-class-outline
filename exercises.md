### Easy Level Exercise

*Exercise 1: Simple Temperature Converter*

Objective: Learn to use variables and conditional statements.

Instructions:

1. Write a program that takes a temperature in Celsius from the user and converts it to Fahrenheit.
2. Use prompt() to get the input from the user.
3. Store the Celsius value in a variable.
4. Convert the Celsius value to Fahrenheit using the formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.
5. Use alert() to display the Fahrenheit value to the user.
6. Include a conditional statement that checks if the input is a number. If it’s not a number, display an error message using alert().

Sample Output:
- If the user enters 0, the program should display: "0°C is 32°F".
- If the user enters a non-numeric value, the program should display: "Please enter a valid number".

### Medium Level Exercise

*Exercise 2: Factorial Calculator*

Objective: Practice loops and basic arithmetic operations.

Instructions:

1. Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number.
2. Use prompt() to get the input number from the user.
3. Store the number into a variable.
4. Use a for loop to calculate the factorial of the number.
5. Display the result using alert().
6. Include error handling to check if the input is a positive integer. If not, display an error message using alert().

Sample Output:
- If the user enters 5, the program should display: "The factorial of 5 is 120".
- If the user enters a non-integer value or a negative number, the program should display: "Please enter a positive integer".

### Hard Level Exercise

*Exercise 3: Number Guessing Game*

Objective: Combine use of variables, loops, and conditional statements while providing user interaction.

Instructions:

1. Write a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
2. The user should have 10 attempts to guess the number.
3. Use Math.random() and Math.floor() to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
4. Use a while loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they have either guessed correctly or used all their attempts.
5. For each guess, give feedback using alert() indicating whether the guess was too high or too low, or if they guessed the number correctly.
6. If the user uses all 10 attempts without guessing the correct number, display a message with the correct number.
7. Optionally, keep track of the number of attempts and display it along with the correct guess message.

Sample Output:
- If the user correctly guesses the number, display: "Congrats! You guessed the number in X attempts."
- If the user fails to guess the number within 10 attempts, display: "Sorry! You used all your attempts. The correct number was Y."

These exercises should sufficiently cover the basic concepts of JavaScript programming and provide a good challenge for students to practice conditional statements, loops, variables, and arithmetic operations.
