# Putting It All Together: Sample Programs

## I. Age Calculator
1. **Objective**: Use of variables, prompt, alert, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic.
2. **Instructions**:
    - Prompt the user to enter their birth year.
    - Store the birth year in a variable.
    - Calculate the user's age based on the current year.
    - Display the calculated age using `alert()`.
    - Include error handling to ensure the input is a valid year and the user is not older than a reasonable age (e.g., 120 years).

## II. Simple Interest Calculator
1. **Objective**: Practice variables, prompt, alert, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic.
2. **Instructions**:
    - Prompt the user to enter the principal amount, rate of interest, and the time period in years.
    - Calculate the simple interest using the formula: `Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100`.
    - Display the calculated interest using `alert()`.
    - Include error handling to ensure all inputs are positive numbers.

## III. Even or Odd Number Checker
1. **Objective**: Use variables, prompt, alert, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic.
2. **Instructions**:
    - Prompt the user to enter a number.
    - Store the number in a variable.
    - Use a conditional statement to check if the number is even or odd.
    - Display the result using `alert()`.
    - Include error handling to ensure the input is a valid number.

## IV. Basic Arithmetic Operations
1. **Objective**: Practice variables, prompt, alert, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic.
2. **Instructions**:
    - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
    - Prompt the user to enter an arithmetic operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
    - Perform the operation on the numbers.
    - Display the result using `alert()`.
    - Include error handling to ensure the inputs are valid numbers and handle division by zero gracefully.

## V. Name Formatter
1. **Objective**: Use of variables, prompt, alert, and string manipulation.
2. **Instructions**:
    - Prompt the user to enter their first name and last name separately.
    - Store the names in variables.
    - Concatenate the first name and last name to display the full name in the format "Last Name, First Name".
    - Display the formatted name using `alert()`.
    - Include error handling to ensure both input fields are filled and valid.

## VI. Multiplication Table Generator
1. **Objective**: Use variables, prompt, alert, loops, and basic arithmetic.
2. **Instructions**:
    - Prompt the user to enter a number.
    - Store the number in a variable.
    - Use a `for` loop to generate the multiplication table for the number from 1 to 10.
    - Display the multiplication table using `alert()` (you may concatenate the results into a string before displaying).
    - Include error handling to ensure the input is a valid number.
